<#
.SYNOPSIS
Re-registers key Windows Update-related DLLs using regsvr32.

.DESCRIPTION
Some update-related components are implemented as COM objects and rely on proper DLL registration.
Corruption or missing entries can block the update agent or cause cryptic errors.

.PARAMETER Silent
Optional. Suppresses output for quiet runs.

.NOTES
Mostly useful for older Windows versions or very broken systems.
Modern Win10/11 rarely need this unless you're manually exorcising update demons.
