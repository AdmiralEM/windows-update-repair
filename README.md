# Windows Update Repair Scripts (PowerShell-Only)

This repo contains modular PowerShell scripts that replicate the functionality of common Windows Update repair tools like [WuReset](https://wureset.com/)‚Äîbut without the need to run unapproved EXEs or installers.

These scripts are designed to be:
- **Individual:** Use one step at a time based on what you're troubleshooting.
- **Readable:** Fully commented for learning and clarity.
- **Flexible:** Supports silent mode for automation, or interactive mode for guided use.

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

**Run a script interactively:**
```powershell
.-stop-update-services.ps1
```

**Run it silently (for automation / scripts):**
```powershell
.-stop-update-services.ps1 -Silent
```

## Requirements

## Disclaimer

These scripts are provided *as-is*. They are safer than random tools off the internet, but you're still responsible for using them correctly. If you're working in an enterprise or restricted environment, check your policies before executing.

---

## Why Use These?

Because most "Windows Update Fixer" tools are either:
- Not allowed on locked-down systems
- Sloppily built with poor transparency
- Doing mystery things behind the scenes

This repo is for those who want full control, transparency, and the ability to script or learn without bullshit.

---

## Future Plans

- Add an optional logging mechanism
- Create a wrapper script that chains all steps in sequence
- Support CLI flags for step-by-step, dry-run, or verbose modes
